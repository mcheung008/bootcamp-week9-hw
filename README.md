# bootcamp-week9-hw 

My updated portfolio from bootcamp-week2-hw.

I added a card showcasing Project 1 onto my portfolio page with a working link however
the api that shows the results for the inputted city no longer works due to expired api.

I fixed the issue noted by my grader for the original week2 hw where the card overlaps when 
the window is resized to a certain dimension by changing the card widths to "auto."
